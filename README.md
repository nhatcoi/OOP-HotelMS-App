# Lecturer's Feedback

+ Call or revoke the work of each task in  the Main inside App.java

for example, revoke class E1 as the code below
+ Co^ delete the App.class because it has no meaning

+ Good start !
```
package com.mycompany.app;
import com.mycompany.app.week1.code3.E1;

public class App {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Group 17");
        //call or revoke the work of each task in  here
        // for example, revoke class E1
        E1 e = new E1();
        e.Ex1();

    }
}

```

# Final Project: Hotel Management System
Content:
  Request:
- JavaFX window interface.
- Has room management function.

   + Add, edit, delete rooms.

  + List whether rooms are available or not. - Has room booking and check-out functions.

  + When processing this function, additional customer booking information is required. - Data is stored in binary files

  + Need to create classes related to "room" to read and write to files.
- When working with data in memory, data needs to be stored in the form of optional Collections such as ArrayList, LinkedList, Map, ....
- Students can add functions to the program for richer applications by learning about hotel management problems (optional).
