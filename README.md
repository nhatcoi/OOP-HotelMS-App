+ Call or revoke the work of each task in  the Main inside App.java

for example, revoke class E1 as the code below
+ Co^ delete the App.class because it has no meaning

+ Good start !
```
package com.mycompany.app;
import com.mycompany.app.week1.code3.E1;

public class App {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Group 17");
        //call or revoke the work of each task in  here
        // for example, revoke class E1
        E1 e = new E1();
        e.Ex1();

    }
}

```
